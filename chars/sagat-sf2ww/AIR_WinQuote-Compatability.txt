Your Mugen characters can be compatible with Sagat's SFII Win Quote system.
All you need to do is apply ONE of the following [OPTION #] lines to your
character's AIR file.

;---------------------------
; Portrait - Victory Winner
[Begin Action 9000]
9000,10, 0,0, -1

; [OPTION #1]
; Portrait - Opponent Defeated
[Begin Action 9001]
9000,11, 0,0, -1

; [OPTION #2]
; Portrait - Opponent Defeated (Get Hit Sprite)
[Begin Action 9005]
5062,0, 0,-10, -1

; [OPTION #3] - MUGEN 1.0 Only
; Portrait - Opponent Defeated High Resolution
[Begin Action 9001]
5062,0, 50,-50, -1

;---------------------------

NOTES:
- [Action 9000] is used to display the portrait of the victory winner of the match.
  It is NOT used by the defeated opponent. However, it is a standard animation action
  for this Win quote system. It is only here for a future reference, and resources.

- [Action 9001] is the ACTUAL defeated portrait. Use if you have an actual protrait.

- [Action 9005] uses a "sprite" of one of the character's hit frames. This is used
  mainly as an alternative for a defeated portrait. If you don't have a defeated
  portrait for your character, you may use this action instead.

- For [OPTION #2], the "sprite" of the character can be any sprite number,
  as long as the second requirement below is met.
  1. It must be a required sprite number, as documented by Mugen's standards.
  2. The sprite offset of the character must be a head position.
     - Examples include 5002, 5012, 5032. In this case, 5062 is used here.
 
  When using [OPTION #2], be aware that the sprite of the defeated opponent
  gets scaled up by 4 times it's original size to act as a display portrait.
  So make sure that the character's hit sprite is not too big.

- If the defeated opponent is using high resolution graphics scale, please
  consider [OPTION #3]. An example of a high resoution character is KFM720.
  [OPTION #3] uses a combination of [OPTION #1] and [OPTION #2]. Since high
  resolution characters are already scaled, using either option besides #3
  will result in the defeated portrait being too big to display properly.
  * - THIS ONLY APPLIES TO MUGEN 1.0 USERS.

- The second set of numbers (0,0) are the X & Y offset positions of the sprite
  of the animation action. If the portrait of the defeated opponent is positioned
  wrong, change these values so that the sprite offset is correct on screen.

- If neither actions 9001 or 9005 exist in the defeated opponent, the win
  quote system will not display after the match is over.
 
- The win quote will NOT display if the character is not a regular
  opponent. Examples of regular opponents include Kung Fu Man.
  Characters that have hit override systems, always invincible, or can not
  be thrown are examples of non-standard opponents.

ANIMATION:
- By default, the Win/Lose portraits have a time of -1. This means there is only
  one frame to display indefinately. However, you may add more frames to your
  lose portrait if you wish. See example below.
; Portrait - Opponent Defeated
[Begin Action 9001]
9000,10, 0,0, 10
9000,11, 0,0, 10
9000,12, 0,0, 10
9000,11, 0,0, 10

;===================================================================================

- If there are any Mugen characters that already use Actions 9000-9005 for other
  reasons besides this, please let me know. I'll see if I can modify the script
  to use alternative animation action numbers.
